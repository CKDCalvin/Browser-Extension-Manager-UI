## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- [WebPack] (https://webpack.js.org/) - JS Bundle

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I Learned

- Configured **Webpack** for frontend application development, including defining entry points, output bundles, and asset handling for JavaScript, CSS, images, and fonts.
- Built and deployed production-ready bundles using Webpack, gaining practical experience with differences between development and production environments.
- Implemented interactive UI features such as **toggle switches and light/dark theme support** using JavaScript event handling and dynamic CSS class manipulation.
- Loaded and rendered external JSON data asynchronously, reinforcing data-driven UI rendering and state updates.
- Configured **Netlify deployment settings** for a Webpack-based application by specifying build commands and publish directories to ensure bundled assets were correctly served in a production environment.


### Continued development

Areas I would like to continue focusing on include better separation of application logic and data loading into dedicated files to improve maintainability and scalability. I also plan to further refine my use of component-based architecture by implementing React.js, which will allow for smoother rendering, better state management, and a more structured approach to building interactive user interfaces.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - This helped me understand how to implement the toggle switch in my application.
