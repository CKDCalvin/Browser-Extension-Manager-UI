### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to use Webpack to bundle JavaScript, CSS, and assets for a more reliable development and deployment workflow. I also gained hands-on experience implementing interactive UI features such as toggle switches and light/dark mode using JavaScript and CSS class manipulation. Additionally, working with external JSON data improved my understanding of asynchronous data loading and dynamic DOM rendering.

### Continued development

Areas I would like to continue focusing on include better separation of application logic and data loading into dedicated files to improve maintainability and scalability. I also plan to further refine my use of component-based architecture by implementing React.js, which will allow for smoother rendering, better state management, and a more structured approach to building interactive user interfaces.

### Useful resources
